Documents and wiki for the Email triage project
This project looks to make it more efficient for FCO consular sections to respond to Brits overseas getting in touch via email.
We're looking to introduce a new form for Brits living overseas to contact the FCO Consular (help for Brits overseas) sections around the world.
Introduce a platform for FCO Contact Centres to handle messages when they arrive more effectively.
